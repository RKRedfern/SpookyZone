Story.create([{ user_id: 1, title: 'The Well', content: 'My grandfather grew up on a chicken farm outside of Krakow, Poland. He passed away a few years ago at the age of 82. A few days before his passing on, due to an aggressive form of stomach cancer, he sat me down next to him in his old rocking chair and said in his familiar polish accent, “After I took the boat to New York, I promised to leave this story behind.”

He didn’t look up as he spoke to me, simply staring into his cup of black coffee. “It’s been 70 years, and I must tell someone before I meet God.”
    
“I was born in a small, quaint, empty town, which, despite the Nazi occupation, still functioned. We lived in this two-bedroom farmhouse, my father, mother, and my brothers Michal and Igor. I’m sorry you never got to meet any of them. Anyway, Michal and Igor were twins – identical twins actually – and we had heard rumors of the Nazi fascination with identical twins. This forced us to be even more reserved, even though we already lived in a secluded part of the countryside, in the last occupied house in the town. In order to avoid going into the occupied towns, we basically ate only chicken and eggs for every meal, and whatever else Mama could gather from the garden. It was lonely, but we survived.
    
“The thing that was most difficult for me was the fact I had to sleep in the basement. Due to Michel and Igor being toddlers, they required my father and mother’s attention. The basement was cold, with only a small window, and the moonlight was the only light I got. Because of this, I always delayed going down there until I was absolutely exhausted, so I wouldn’t have to lie there awake. On the nights that I couldn’t manage to sleep, I would look out of the window, which gave me a small view of the garden and the large, abandoned water well. This was my daily activity throughout those lonely war-torn nights. In general, it was boring and uneventful, but occasionally I would catch a glimpse of a family, or even just a man, or two lovers, sneaking their way through our garden up to our front door. They always looked rushed and frightened, and sometimes wore tattered uniforms. What would follow were horrible sounds of banging and pleadings for whoever lived there to open up, followed by an argument between my father and mother over whether we should let them in.”
    
He moved in the chair to adjust himself.
    
“You see, son, we didn’t know it – well, at least I didn’t – that we lived fairly close to the Auschwitz Concentration Camp, and that those people were escapees.”
    
“Well, did your father let them in?!” I asked impatiently.
    
“No,” he said. “It would have been a death sentence for them as well as for us. The Nazis didn’t like Poles, but they tolerated us, and it was easier to hide Michel or Igor than an entire family. My father did what he had to do in order to keep his family alive. As the war went on, fewer and fewer people began showing up in the middle of the night. That’s about the time our chicken and vegetables began to disappear. Losing our only supply of food would not have been tolerable, and at that point, my father suspected it was the escapees, so he built a fence around our property. Despite this, the chickens continued to disappear. They weren’t killed; they were simply gone. Just vanished from their cages and pens.
    
“One night, I decided to stay up myself in order to see if I could find out the answer. I battled my tiredness until the wee hours of the morning, and despite the poor lighting and rain, I caught a glimpse of what seemed to be a human figure run across the garden. I rushed upstairs to tell my father, and he ran outside with a knife, the best home-defense weapon we could afford, but we found nothing. No one.”
    
“The next day we did find something, though. Footprints. Leading from the chicken cages to the water well. They were made in the wet mud from the rain, and they were of bare feet. No shoes. No socks. Just feet. My father had mercy on the man who was trying to find refuge and left him a note, indicating that he had two days to leave and then he would begin to seal the well.”
    
I waited impatiently for my grandfather to tell me about the fate of the man.
    
“The following night, I got the idea to take a blanket down the well to the man since winter was creeping in. I waited until my parents were asleep and I snuck outside. I shouted something friendly down the well, indicating to the poor man that my intentions were benign, and I began my descent, clinging hand and foot to the pegs attached to the stones. As I neared the bottom I smelled something absolutely horrific, and I pulled my father’s flashlight from my pocket to try and shine it on the man. It was then I came to the realization of just how large the well was, having been used to supply water for the entire town and its families in the past. Families which no longer remained.
    
“But I found no man, only a hole. A gap in the stone, where the wall of the well had collapsed, opening up to some type of crevice only two meters wide and three meters deep and tall. Inside sat not a man, but an entire family, of which only a single skeleton-like creature survived. The light reflected off of its sunken eyes and gray skin. Blood covered its face, and chicken carcasses were strewn everywhere – a pile of decomposing poultry beside a woman and what I suspected had been her son and daughter, children who couldn’t have been much more than five years old. And they seemed to have been dead for weeks. The man, if he even could be called that, just gazed at the light, and I stared back, incapable of breaking his stare. I did not feel threatened by him, for he lacked any aggression whatsoever. He simply crouched motionlessly, without a sound, next to the putrefying bodies of his loved ones and the chickens that must have been his source of water, as their meat was uneaten.
    
“He was empty, devoid of whatever in us makes us human. He should have realized the members of his family had died long ago, but he was still bringing food for their corpses. He couldn’t accept it. He did finally turn his head, though, when I shone the light back onto the corpse of his daughter. He stared at her, and then sat down closer to her, and continued his vigil.
    
“’You can leave now,’ I said to him. ‘I’ll open the gate so you can escape. My father will seal the well in the morning. Please leave now.’ My young voice and advice seemed to have no effect on him.
    
“At that moment I decided it would be better for me to just climb back up the well and leave, and hoped the man would follow and escape. As I began my climb, I shone the light on him one final time.”
    
“What did you see, Grandpa?” I shuttered.
    
“I saw a tear fall from his eye. He had become a man once again. He was only able to break free from the delusion after seeing the body of his daughter, which had until that time been obscured by the darkness. He realized then that he had been bringing food not to his family, but to corpses.
    
“That night it rained again, but in the morning when my father returned to seal the well, I found no footprints leading out of it.”'}, 
    
{user_id:2, title:'The Staring Doll', content:"Heather was at her friend Jenny’s house one afternoon.  It was just after school and Jenny’s parents hadn’t arrived home from work yet.  It was just the two of them, and they were engrossed in a board game.

Heather was having a good time, except they were playing in a room adjacent to Jenny’s parent’s bedroom, and every now and then Heather would glance up through the open door of that bedroom to see a little girl doll sitting up on the bed.  Its eyes appeared to be staring at them.  She tried to ignore it, but over time it started to get to her.
    
“I’m sorry,” she said. “But I can’t concentrate.  That doll on the bed over there is giving me the creeps.”
    
“Oh, no problem,” Jenny replied.  She went to the room and closed to the door to calm Heather down.  Then the two friends resumed their game.
    
It hadn’t been long, however, before Heather glanced up again.  The door was open once again, and again the doll appeared to be staring at them.  Jenny couldn’t understand it.  She could swear that there was nobody else home, and that there was no way the door could have opened without the knob being turned.  Shrugging, she went up to the bedroom and closed the door, this time making sure that it clicked shut.  But again and again, they would check the door and find it wide open.
    
Heather was starting to get very scared.  Finally, Jenny had enough of this.  She went into the bedroom, grabbed the doll and threw it into the closet, slamming it shut.  She then slammed the bedroom door shut behind her, and they resumed their game.
    
For a while, things appeared to be going well. But then Heather glanced up one last time. All of a sudden she stood up and said, “Goodbye!” and ran home as fast as she could.
    
This time when Jenny looked up, she saw the bedroom door only slightly ajar, with a chair propped up behind it.  And sitting on the chair – peeking through the opening at them – was the doll."},

{user_id: 2, title:'Sunrise', content:'Everyone loves a good scare. That’s why you’re browsing posts here, correct? You thought it would be fun just before you go to bed to scare yourself just a tad bit. Harmless fun of reading that, while getting your heart to race; never puts you in real danger.

So, what’s tonight’s topic for your nightmares?

Jeff the Killer with his Go to Sleep?
    
Slenderman silently stalking you wherever you venture?
    
A Candle Cove experience that hits home so nostalgically for you that it seem true?
    
Or, maybe.
    
Just maybe.

Something new and unique that haunts you in an unexpected way?
    
Whatever the case, you keep reading. Perhaps it’s all just a big joke to you. Something you laugh off rather than take seriously. No one’s holding a gun to your head, after all; you’re doing exactly what you’re doing of your own free will.
    
You need to stop now.
    
Stop reading this for your own sake.
    
S-T-O-P

You’re still here.
    
It’s your own fault, you know.
    
You’ve programmed it so deep in the back of brain that just being told to stop is completely ignored.
    
Optimistic about what’s next, aren’t you?

That’ll be your undoing. Just taking things as they happen; without a care in the world. Thinking your room is safe just because you have the only key to it. You have no idea how unsafe you are.
    
I know so much about you yet you know nothing about me. The last time you ever acknowledge my mere presence was when you were still pissing the bed. You called me the monster in your room or the boogieman.
    
You’ve just been blocking me out since then, really. You told yourself it was nothing but loose clothing or a misshapen shadow cast by one of your toys. I’ve never stopped watching, however. My dark red eyes stare at you even now just out of your peripheral vision.
    
Chills down your spine, I see.
    
Are you remembering the noose around my neck?
    
The tattered dark rags I wear?
    
The burlap sack over my face; which I have for your sake, so you’ll never know my true unfathomable horror that it hides?
    
My decaying, long nailed hands?
    
There’s that look.
    
The same look you had all those years ago.
    
One last request I see painted on your face.
    
Who am I?
    
Call me the Sunrise Killer.
    
All coming back to you, now; isn’t it?
Those unexplained murders you glanced by in the paper over the years.
    
I’m not bragging but I won’t deny them.
    
Nothing but practice.
    
For you.
    
Every single one.
    
Of you.
    
The brave ones who’ve prepared so long for something to happen at the apex of night.
    
It is darkest before dawn.
    
So, for you.
    
Just you.
    
The most hopeful of them all.
    
Look on the bright side.
    
You still have an hour before sunrise'},  

{user_id: 3, title:'Friends', content:'I don’t remember much about my childhood, like most people. Those memories are always vague and eventually you realise whatever you ‘remember’ is probably just a reconstructed memory. You don’t have much choice in the matter, and are usually convinced that your memory would never fail you.

    The first memory I have was when I was 5. I’m not sure if it’s real or not, but that’s when I think I met Michael. I never had any friends, so I was glad when I met him. He called me Jack, and I liked it. As uncertain I am if I remember our first encounter, there is no doubting the strong bond we immediately formed.
    
    I won’t bore you with the details of what we did every day for the past few years, but I will outline some of the things we did together, to assure even the most sceptical among the readers of our friendship.

    Michael, being a slightly effeminate child didn’t have many friends at school either. He was bullied, and the highlight of his day was coming home and sharing a cup of tea with me, all the while telling me of his woes and lessening his burden. The tea, unlike my words of consolation, was make believe.
    Another one of his favourite activities was cutting my hair. He would style it in all sorts of ways and I enjoyed each one of them. Fortunately for him, my hair grew inexplicably fast and he often got a chance to restyle it.
    
    There was one thing that constantly strained out relationship, though. Don’t get me wrong, Michael and I had absolutely no hard feeling towards each other. It was his parents. I don’t think they approved of me, and I couldn’t tell you why even if I tried.
    
    It wasn’t just disapproval; I began to think they hated me. The longer our friendship lasted, the worse it got. It pains me to even think about it, so I won’t dwell on this for long.
    
    As quickly as our relationship had initially flourished, it began to diminish after two years. Michael grew to become a stocky football player, and I remained exactly the same as before; scrawny and completely incapable of competing athletically.
    
    He made new friends and started to ignore me. This hurt me a lot, especially since I was there for him in his time of need. His abandoning me was the last thing I expected and it hit me hard. I felt like I had no one left in the world.

    As I sit in the corner of the room and write this, I can see Michael and his friends watching T.V. Sometimes it seems like he notices me and looks my way, but I know better. I have now resigned to my fate; He created me, but forgot to destroy me.'},  

{user_id: 3, title:'Stairs', content:'In 1984, there lived an old widowed lady by herself in a two story house who was completely immobile and bound to her wheelchair. Ever since the mysterious death of her husband, she required the aid of a carer who would visit her daily to help her with everyday tasks. What made it even more difficult, was the fact that the two floors of the house were only connected by an old staircase inside. When the old lady needed to move between the two, the carer would have to carry her frail body like an infant, up and down the stairs. One day the police received a call from the widow. There had been a murder.

    Since police units were scarce at the time, and the murderer had already fled the scene, only one detective was sent out to conduct the initial crime scene report. He arrived to see the carer’s body splayed out on the floor with her vocal chords ripped out in a pool of blood on the first level of the house, with the old lady atop the staircase in her wheelchair watching him, still and silently, seemingly in shock. He could immediately rule her out as a suspect, due to her inability to move up and down the stairs, and because she was trapped up there the time the murder took place. It was similar to the death of her husband many years ago, who had suffocated in his sleep on the couch downstairs.
    
    The detective put on his gloves, took photos, swabbed for evidence, and covered the body until the coroner arrived later – all routine business. He scoped the house downstairs for any clues, then asked the old lady if he could look upstairs. She insisted that she was upstairs the whole time and no one apart from her had been up there that day, but regardless of this the detective ascended the staircase to which she hesitantly moved aside.
    
    Beyond the staircase, there was a narrow corridor, with three closed doors along it. He checked behind each of the doors, the empty bedroom – nothing, the bathroom- nothing. He became anxious as he slowly made his way to the final bedroom where the old lady slept. He opened it and everything looked normal. A bed, a wardrobe and a bedside table with a lamp. He checked every wall of the room in horror, as it was not what he discovered, but it was what he didn’t discover that made him stop dead in his tracks and slowly reach for his gun in its holster. It was a detail so minor that they had completely overlooked it on the last investigation of the husband’s death. There was no phone upstairs. He suddenly heard a noise as he withdrew his gun and rushed out of the room, only to find an empty wheelchair atop the stairs.'}])
